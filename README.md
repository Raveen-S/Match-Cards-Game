# Match-Cards-Game
A fun and engaging memory-based Match Card game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of 16 cards placed face down. Players click on a card to flip it and try to find a matching pair by flipping a second card. If the two cards match, they remain face up; if not, they flip back down.
